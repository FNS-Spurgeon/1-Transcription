Gower, and Lydgate, and the other tribe of rhymers that pre¬
ceded the reign of Henry VIII. They seem to me to have
acquired their fame before the nation knew anything of poetry,
and to have remained famous when their works are no longer
read. There is a little sprinkling here and there of naïveté in
Chaucer, but his lists and catalogues of circumstances are any¬
thing but poetry. Lydgate is bare naked prose. ...

It is evident from the first stanza of this poem (just quoted),

intended it for one of his Canterbury Tales, and this seems
to be confirmed by the 65th stanza of the first book.

The moral Virtues are disposed fair:
Then glorious Milton, who surpass'd his reign
In depths of Hell and in th' Olympick air:
But, most of all, and to our wond’ring eyes,

And made a spoil of his posterity;
When he was born, great Nature did her most,
And when he died, the World’s delight was lost!

Some writers have considered the Sir Thopas of Chaucer as
p. 146]
a prelude to the work of Cervantes. It may be much to the
honour of the English poet that he so early discerned and
ridiculed the absurdities of his contemporary romancers, but
it cannot be conceived that Sir Thopas had any effect in
discrediting their compositions.

[p. 236] If the frame in which Boccaccio has set his Decameron be

--------------- Element 5 (1925_vol2_84.jpg) ---------------

it will be found that the time chosen by Boccaccio is infinitely
preferable to that adopted by the English poet. The pilgrims
of the latter relate their stories on a journey, though they are
on horseback, and are twenty-nine in number; and it was
intended, had the author completed his plan, that this rabble
should have told the remainder of their tales in an abominable
tavern at Canterbury. On the other hand, the Florentine
assembly discourse in tranquillity and retirement... But
then the frame of Chaucer afforded a much greater oppor¬
tunity of displaying a variety of striling and dramatic
characters, and thence of introducing characteristic tales.
His assemblage is mixed and fortuitous, and his travellers
are distinguished from each other both in person and character.
Even his serious pilgrims are marked by their several sorts
[p. 237] of gravity, and the ribaldry of his low characters is different.
'I see', says Dryden, 'every one of the pilgrims in the
Canterbury Tales as distinctly as if I had supped with them.'
All the company in the Decameron, on the other hand, are
fine ladies and gentlemen of Florence, who retire to enjoy
the sweets of select society, and who would scarcely have
tolerated the intrusion of such figures as the Miller or the
Sompnour.

[p. 342] This story of Boccaccio [Decam. x, 6] is the origin of the
Frankelein's Tale of Chaucer, in which the circumstances are
precisely the same as in the Decameron, except that the
impossible thing required of the lady is, that her lover should
remove the rocks from the coast of Britany [sic]: a similar
tale, however, according to Tyrwhitt, occurs in an old Breton
lay, from which he conceives the incidents may have come
immediately to the English poet...
[p. 343] The tale of Boccaccio is supposed by the editor of Beaumont

[vol xi,
p. 482]
Chaucer himself was a star of the first magnitude: no
man ever did so much with a language in so rude a state, and
only Shakespeare has surpassed him in his intuitive know¬
ledge of human character, and the universality of his genius.
Mr. Chalmers indeed, with that comfortable self-satisfaction
which he derives from flourishing in the nineteenth century,
when the world has the advantage of being enlightened by
lectures on poetry, assures us that Chaucer's popularity is
gone by:—it may be so with those ladies and gentlemen who
conceive poetry to be 'the art of pleasing,' and believe that
nothing which requires thought can possibly give pleasure.
Chaucer has not written for critics and readers of this nature:
... the rank which the father of English poetry holds in
literature has not been assigned by caprice, or fashion, or
superstition. He whom Spenser called his master, and
whom Milton referred to as to his great and immortal prede¬
cessor, is justly placed with them in the first class of poets,
and his fame, like theirs, is for ever. It is a reproach to our
literature that the Canterbury Tales should be the only portion
of his works which have been edited with any degree of care
or ability.
[vol. xii,
p. 64]
He [the author of The Cid] built with rubbish and
unhewn stones; Dante and Petrarca with marble. Chaucer's
materials more resembled those of the Spaniard than of the
Italian poets. This has been in some degree unfortunate for
himself, inasmuch as the progressive improvement of our

tongue has at length rendered him obsolete, (or rather caused
him to be thought so,) and thus deprived him of that exten¬
sive and pre-eminent popularity which he long and deservedly
enjoyed. ...
[p. 65]
Chaucer drew much from the French and Italian poets,
but more from observation and the stores of his own wealthy
and prolific mind. Strong English sense, and strong English
humour characterize his original works. He caught with a
painter's hand the manners and features of the age; he beheld
the objects of external nature with a poet’s eye, and he pene¬
trated with a poet's intuition into the recesses of the human
heart. Dante holds a higher place in literature because he
wrought with materials which were capable of displaying and
preserving his exquisite skill. Dante may be classed above all
other poets for strength and severity of style: Nothing can be
worse than the plan of the Divina Commedia; the matter is
sometimes puerile, sometimes shocking, frequently dull, but
the style is uniformly perfect. Here Chaucer falls short of
him, but only here, where, from the state of the English
language, it was impossible that he should prove his equal:
in extent and variety of power he is greatly his superior.
[During the 15th century] there could be little encourage¬
ment for poetry, and what was produced chiefly consisted
either of dull translations, or vapid imitations of Chaucer.
The 'style ornate' had been introduced, and was sanctioned
by Chaucer's name: of the poems in that style which are
printed as his, many are of questionable authority; few traces
of it are to be found in his greater and better works; and it
seems probable that he just tried the experiment, and convinced
himself of its unfitness.
