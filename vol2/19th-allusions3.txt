of damage to his verses may have been so considerable, that
we could not be sure of restoring them to perfect purity, even
if we had several manuscripts of the date 1400 before us. But
by far the larger part of the irregularities and corruptions with
vhich the text is now loaded are undoubtedly of later origin,
and there is no reason why, (if we are allowed only to take for
granted that Chaucer had an ear, and meant to write good
metre,+) by taking pains enough, by a patient comparison of
[p. 450] apparently uncorrupted verses, followed by a collation of good
contemporary manuscripts, and of the forms of earlier and
contemporary authors, we should not at last obtain a text
approximately correct.

of his lines evidently consist... of ten syllables only; and such a
construction of verse, for ordinary purposes, is become so much more

[p. iv]
So far as narrative power and versification are concerned,
he [Brunne] seems to me the worthiest forerunner of Chaucer,—
the cheery dear old man, who so loved women, and the "glad
light green" of spring [from the Flour and the Lefe], and
made his verse instinct with the grace and brightness that
he saw in the objects of his love.
[p. xxii] The MS. [of Handlyng Synne] was accordingly copied, and
then came the question as to how much of the text was
Robert's own, and how much translated from Wadington.

The only way to answer this was by printing Wadington's

intrigue.

[p. 459] Chaucer is admitted on all hands to be a great poet, but by
the general public, at least, he is not frequently read. He is
like a cardinal virtue, a good deal talked about, a good deal
praised, a good deal admired, but very seldom practised.
[Reasons for this :] He is an ancient... He is garrulous,
homely and slow-paced... He does not dazzle by sentences;
[p. 460] he is not quotable. [His kindliness; visible in his face.

translate Chaucer, or modernize Chaucer; they committed

lacks historical perspective (p. 8). His genius, though of the
rarest kind, was not of the highest order (p. 9). The essential
characteristic of it is a strong sense of the real (p. 12). Some
account follows of Chaucer's life and reading (pp. 14-16), and
his works are then reviewed in some detail, arranged in
six divisions: Grave Stories; Comic Stories; Pieces of suffi¬

For English poetical production on a great scale, for an
English poet deploying all the forces of his genius, the ten¬
syllable couplet was, in the eighteenth century, the established,
one may almost say the inevitable, channel. Now this
couplet, admirable (as Chaucer uses it) for story-telling not
of the epic pitch, and often admirable for a few lines even in
poetry of a very high pitch, is for continuous use in poetry
of this latter kind inadequate.

Alive and, as of yore, alert!

Would we two have with monk and nun.
Ah, surely verse was never meant
To render mortals somnolent.
In Spenser’s labyrinthine rhymes
I throw my arms o’erhead at times,
Opening sonorous mouth as wide
As oyster shells at ebb of tide...
No bodyless and soulless elves
I seek, but creatures like ourselves...
Thou wast content to act the squire
Becomingly, and mount no higher,
Nay, at fit season to descend
Into the poet with a friend,
Then ride with him about the land
In lithesome nut-brown boots well tann'd...
The lesser Angels now have smiled
To see thee frolic like a child,
And hear thee, innocent as they,
Provoke them to come down and play.
[SQUIBS, CRACKERS, SERPENTS, etc...]
I leaving good old Homer, not o’erlong,
Enjoy the merriment of Chaucer's tales.
[WRONGS HAVE I SUFFERED...]
Wrongs have I suffered, great and many,
Insufferable never any
Like that prepensely murderous one
An Oxford hang-dog rogue has done,
Who shoved me on a bench with men
Biting the point of Chaucer's pen.
Chaucer I always loved, for he
Led me to woo fair Poesie.
He of our craft the worthy foreman
Stood gallantly against the Norman,

poet the island produced; and he wrote for the most part in
the language of the people.... In his earlier poems he was
under the influence of the Provençal Troubadours, and in his
"Flower and the Leaf" and other works of a similar class, he
riots in allegory.... He lived in a brilliant and stirring
time; he was connected with the court; he served in armies;
he visited the Continent; and, although a silent man, he
carried with him, wherever he went, and into whatever
[p. 69] company he was thrown, the most observant eyes perhaps that
ever looked curiously out upon the world. ... And so it was
that, after mixing in kings' courts, and sitting with friars in
taverns, and talking with people on country roads, and travel¬
ling in France and Italy, and making himself master of the
literature, science, and theology of his time, and when perhaps
touched with misfortune and sorrow, he came to see the depth
of interest that resides in actual life. ... It is difficult to
define Chaucer's charm. He does not indulge in fine senti¬
ments; he has no bravura passages; he is ever master of him¬
self and of his subject. The light upon his page is the light
[p. 70] of common day.... It is his shrewdness, his conciseness, his
ever-present humour, his frequent irony, and his short homely
line—effective as the play of the short Roman sword—which
strikes the reader most. [Chaucer and Fielding compared in
their common-sense and English relish for fact.] Chaucer was
a Conservative in all his feelings; he liked to poke his fun at
the clergy, but he was not of the stuff of which martyrs are
made...
[p. 71]
Chaucer was born about 1328, and died about 1380.

ship-in-chief, and, after refusals by Aldis Wright and Skeat,
Bradshaw accepted it, but soon found that he had not the

Also in 1864 Alexander Macmillan proposed to Bradshaw a
small edition in the Globe series. So late as 1879, in con¬
junction with Furnivall, Bradshaw had some specimen pages
