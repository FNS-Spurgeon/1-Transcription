[a. 1400.] Unknown. The Gest hystoriale of the destruction of Troy
Unique MS., Hunterian museum, Glasgow, bk. xix, fol 124 b,
ll. 8051-4 (ed. G. A. Panton and David Donaldson, E. E. T. soc.,

The sorow of Troilus for Breisaid his loue.
. . . . . . . .
No lengur of thies louers list me to carpe,
Ne of the feynit fate of þat faire lady;
Who-so wilnes to wit of þaire wo fir,
Turne hym to Troilus, & talke þere ynoghe!
[It is doubtful whether this allusion 'Turne hym to Troilus and talke þere
ynoghe' refers to Chaucer's Troilus, but there is a possibility that it may do so.
The whole Gest is an amplified englishing of Guido de Colonna’s Historia Trojana
(c. 1381-82), and the corresponding passage in Guido runs:—"Cedo, Troile, quæ te
tam juvenilis errare Coegit Credulitas, ut Briseidæ lacrimis crederes deceptivis et
ejus blanditiis"; and in what precedes and follows, the English book follows
Guido pretty closely; so that it seems likely that the passage is suggested by
him.]

1 [This statement by Lydgate, which is repeated by Bale ('Dantem Italum transtulit,' see
below, App. A. 1557-9), Speght (in his list of Chaucer's works in his 1598 edn. fol. ci.), Laurence
Humphrey, 1582 below, p. 122, Edward Leigh 1656, pp. 232-8, and others, has given rise to
considerable discussion as to whether Chaucer did or did not translate any part of Dante (see
Studies in Chaucer, by T. R. Lounsbury, vol. i, p. 425, vol. ii, pp. 236-7). Prof. Skeat holds
that under this name Lydgate is referring to the 'House of Fame' which shows marked Dante
infuence (Minor Poems of Chaucer, pp. Ixx-lxxi, see also an article by A. Rambeau, in Englische
Studien, 1880, vol. iii, p. 209, 'Chaucer's House of Fame in seinem Verhältniss zu Dante's
Divina Commedia'). Dr. Paget Toynbee does not agree that this refers to the House of Fame,
as Lydgate was ignorant of Italian, see Dante in English Literature, 1900, pp. 1-2.]
