[sign. B8b] The stories, which we now find only in remoter authours,
were in his [Shakespeare’s] time accessible and familiar. The
fable of As You Like it, which is supposed to be copied from
Chaucer's Gamelyn, was a little pamphlet of those times;
and old Mr. Cibber remembered the tale of Hamlet in plain
English prose, which the criticks have now to seek in Saxo
Grammaticus.
[sign. C 4] Our author [Shakespeare] had both matter and form to
provide; for except the characters of Chaucer, to whom I
think he is not much indebted, there were no writers in
English, and perhaps not many in other modern languages,
which shewed life in its native colours.
[sign. E 3] The criticks on ancient authours have, in the exercise of
their sagacity, many assistances, which the editor of Shake¬
speare is condemned to want. They are employed upon
grammatical and settled languages, whose construction con¬
tributes so much to perspicuity, that Homer has fewer
passages unintelligible than Chaucer.

An original Ballad by Chaucer.
This little sonnet, which hath escaped all the editors of
Chaucer's works, is now printed for the first time from an
ancient MS. in the Pepysian library, that contains many other
poems of its venerable author. The versification is of that
species, which the French call RONDEAU, very naturally
englished by our honest countrymen ROUND O. Tho' so
early adopted by them, our ancestors had not the honour of
inventing it: Chaucer picked it up, along with other better
things, among the neighbouring nations. A fondness for
laborious trifles hath always prevailed in the dawn of litera¬
ture. The ancient Greek poets had their WINGS and AXES: the
great father of English poesy may therefore be pardoned one
poor solitary RONDEAU.—Dan Geofrey Chaucer died Oct. 25,
1400, aged 72.

[p. 18] It does honour to the good sense of this nation, that while
all Europe was captivated with the bewitching charms of
Chivalry and Romance, two of our writers in the crudest
times could see thro' the false glare that surrounded them, and
discover whatever was absurd in them both. Chaucer wrote
his Rhyme of sir Tropas [sic] in ridicule of the latter, and in

[p. 109] The Name of Chaucer is peculiarly endeared to every lover
of English Poetry. His great and distinguished poetical
abilities, in an age in which polite literature... was little
known,... his admirable talent at painting manners and
characters; and some other circumstances in which he has
been thought to resemble the immortal Grecian Poet, have
occasioned him to be frequently stiled the ENGLISH HOMER,
and the FATHER of the English Poets...
[p. 127] As a Poet, our author has been deservedly considered as
one of the greatest, as well as earliest, which this nation
has produced. Allowing for those unavoidable defects which
arise from the fluctuation of language, his works have still all
the beauties which can be wished for, or expected, in every
species of composition which he attempted; for it has been
truly said, that he excelled in all the different kinds of verse
in which he wrote. In his sonnets, or love songs, written
when he was a mere boy, there is not only fire and judgment,
but great elegance of thought, and neatness of composition...
As he had a discerning eye, he discovered nature in all her
appearances, and stripped off every disguise with which the
Gothic writers had clothed her... and... despising the
mean assistances of art, he copied her closely. He was an
excellent master of love poetry, having studied that passion
in all its turns and appearances; and Mr. Dryden prefers
him upon that account to Ovid. His Troilus and Creseide
is one of the most beautiful poems of that kind, in which
--------------- Element 49 (1925 Vol 1 _page-0623.jpg) ---------------
430 Five Hundred Years of [AD. 1767-
love is curiously and naturally described, in its early appear¬
ance, its hopes and fears, its application, fruition and despair
in disappointment. That in the elegiac poetry he was a
great master, appears evidently by his Complaint of the black
Knight, the poem called La belle Dame sans mercy, and
several of his songs. And his great talents in the satirical
and comic way, are strikingly evident. [Warton’s remark on
humour in Observations on... Spenser, 1754, is then quoted,
followed by appreciations by Ascham, Sidney, Beaumont and
Dryden.]

Let me here make an observation for the benefit of the
next Editor of Chaucer. Mr. Urry, probably misled by his
predecessor, Speght, was determined, Procrustes-like, to force
every line in the Canterbury Tales to the same Standard; but
a precise number of Syllables was not the Object of our old
Poets.... Chaucer himself was persuaded, that the Rime
might possibly be
— 'somewhat agreáble,
Though some Verse faile in a Sylláble.'
[House of Fame, Il. 1097-8.]
In short the attention was directed to the Cæsural pause, as
the Grammarians call it; [Farmer then quotes Gascoigne's

Chatterton died on 24th Aug., 1770, and the scanty refer¬
ences to Chaucer in his poems and prose articles, and in those
of his manuscript notes which survive, are accordingly entered
here under that year.
The Rowley Poems were very well edited by Tyrwhitt
in 1777, with Chatterton’s own notes (the Advertisement
on p. xxvii states that “the notes at the bottom of the several
pages, throughout the following part of this book [i. e. the
text], are all copied from MSS. in the handwriting of Thomas
Chatterton"). Tyrwhitt added an Appendix to edn. 3, 1778
(see below, p. 451), shewing that Chatterton was their
author. Warton took the same view in his History of English
Poetry, vol. ii, 1778 (see below, p. 454). In 1778 Dampier
or Woodward, in 1781 Bryant, and in 1782 Milles (see
below, pp. 456, 458, 468) and others defended the authen¬
ticity of the Poems, which was impugned by Mason or
Baynes, Malone and others. See below, 1781-1782 passim.
The Chattertonian controversy was finally summed up by
W. W. Skeat in his edition of Chatterton, 1871, vol. ii,
pp. xxiv-xxvii. The references to Chaucer in the controversy
consist chiefly of notes on similar or dissimilar use of words
in both poets, of allusions to Chatterton’s having borrowed
Speght, and of some unimportant remarks on Chaucer's
versification. In most cases therefore the bare reference is
all that is given here.]

gleam of poetry in their compositions between the Scalds and
Chaucer. ... I am sorry Mr. Warton has contracted such

that not only Pope but Dryden himself have added few
beauties to Chaucer.

[p. 396] Pope has imitated this piece [House of Fame], with his
usual elegance of diction and harmony of versification. But
in the meantime he has not only misrepresented the story, but
marred the character of the poem. He has endeavoured to
correct it’s extravagancies by new refinements and additions
of another cast: but he did not consider, that extravagancies
are essential to a poem of such a structure, and even constitute
it’s beauties. An attempt to unite order and exactness of
imagery with a subject formed on principles so professedly
romantic and anomalous, is like giving Corinthian pillars to a
Gothic palace. When I read Pope’s elegant imitation of this
piece, I think I am walking among the modern monuments
unsuitably placed in Westminster-abbey.
. . . . . . . . . . .
[p. 435] But Chaucer's vein of humour, although conspicuous in
the Canterbury Tales, is chiefty displayed in the Characters
vith which they are introduced. In these his knowledge of
the world availed him in a peculiar degree, and enabled
him to give such an accurate picture of antient manners,
as no cotemporary nation has transmitted to posterity.
It is here that we view the pursuits and employments, the
customs and diversions, of our ancestors, copied from the life,
and represented with equal truth and spirit, by a judge of
mankind, whose penetration qualified him to discern their
foibles or discriminating peculiarities; and by an artist, who
understood that proper selection of circumstances, and those
predominant characteristics, which form a finished portrait.
We are surprised to find, in so gross and ignorant an age,
such talents for satire, and for observation on life; qualities
which usually exert themselves at more civilised periods. ...
These curious and valuable remains are specimens of Chaucer's
native genius, unassisted and unalloyed. ...

that in a work of this general nature, I should enter into a
critical examination of all Chaucer's pieces. Enough has
been said to prove, that in elevation, and elegance, in harmony
and perspicuity of versification, he surpasses his predecessors
in an infinite proportion: that his genius was universal,
and adapted to themes of unbounded variety: that his merit
was not less in painting familiar manners with humour and
propriety, than in moving the passions, and in representing the
beautiful or the grand objects of nature with grace and sublimity.

of Chaucer.
[vol. iv, The Language of Chaucer has undergone two very different

judgements. According to one, he is the “well of English
undefiled"; according to the other, he has corrupted and
deformed the English idiom by an immoderate mixture of
French words. Nor do the opinions with respect to his
Versification seem to have been less discordant. His con¬

[p. 2] temporaries, and they who lived nearest to his time, universally
extoll him as the “chief Poete of Britaine," “the flour of
Poetes," etc., titles, which must be supposed to implie their
admiration of his metrical skill, as well as of his other poetical
[p. 3] talents; but the later critics, though they leave him in posses¬
sion of the same sounding titles, yet are almost unanimously
agreed, that he was either totally ignorant or negligent of
metrical rules, and that his verses (if they may be so called)
are frequently deficient, by a syllable or two, of their just
measure.
It is the purpose of the following Essay to throw some
light upon both these questions. Admitting the fact, that the
English of Chaucer has a great mixture of French in it, I
hope to shew, that this mixture (if a crime) cannot fairly
be laid to his charge. I shall then proceed to state some
observations upon the most material peculiarities of the
Norman-Saxon, or English language, as it appears to have
been in general use in the age of Chaucer; and lastly, apply¬
ing these observations to the poetical parts of the Canterbury
Tales, as they are faithfully printed in this edition from the
[p. 4] best Mss. which I coud procure, I shall leave it to the
intelligent Reader to determine, whether Chaucer was really
ignorant of the laws, or even of the graces, of Versification,
and whether he was more negligent of either than the very
early Poets in almost all languages are found to have been.
. . . . . . . . . . .
[pp. 4-26 contain an account of the reasons for the great
admixture of French in English in the 12th, 13th and 14th
centuries.]
. . . . . . . .
[p. 26] From what has been said, I think, we may fairly
conclude, that the English language must have imbibed a
strong tincture of the French, long before the age of Chaucer,
and consequently that he ought not to be charged as the
importer of words and phrases, which he only used after
the example of his predecessors and in common with his
contemporaries. ... [pp. 26-28, more proof of this.

time of Chaucer. pp. 46-75. State of English poetry

[p. 38]
In order... to form any judgement of the Versification
of Chaucer, it is necessary that we should know the syllabical
value... of his words, and the accentual value of
--------------- Element 63 (1925 Vol 1 _page-0641.jpg) ---------------
444 [Tyrwhitt.] Five Hundred Years of [AD. 1775
his syllables, as they were commonly pronounced in his
[p. 89] time, for without that knowledge, it is not more probable that
we should determine justly upon the exactness of his metres,
than that we should be able to cast up rightly an account
stated in coins of a former age, of whose current rates and
denominations we are totally ignorant.
. . . . . . . . . . .
[p. 91] The great number of verses, sounding complete even to our
ears, which is to be found in all the least corrected copies of
his works, authorizes us to conclude, that he was not ignorant
of the laws of metre. Upon this conclusion it is impossible
not to ground a strong presumption, that he intended to observe
the same laws in the many other verses which seem to us
irregular; and if this was really his intention, what reason
can be assigned sufficient to account for his having failed so
grossly and repeatedly, as is generally supposed, in an opera¬
tion, which every Ballad-monger in our days, man, woman, or
child, is known to perform with the most unerring exactness,
and without any extraordinary fatigue?...
. . . . . . . . . . .
[p. 93] But a great number of Chaucer's verses labour under an
apparent Deficiency of a syllable, or two. In some of these
perhaps the defect may still be supplied from MSS.; but for
the greatest part I am persuaded no such assistance is to be
expected; and therefore, supposing the text in these cases to
[p. 94] be correct, it is worth considering whether the verse also may
not be made correct, by adopting in certain words a pronun¬
ciation, different indeed from modern practice, but which, we
have reason to believe, was used by the author himself.
For instance, in the Genitive case Singular and the Plural
Number of Nouns... there can be no doubt that such
