On the other hand, neither Dr. Macaulay, the editor of Gower, nor many other
Chaucer students, accept Prof. Tatlock’s identification of Gower's geste with Chaucer's
poem. It upsets the generally received scheme of Chaucer's chronology, and is
moreover contradicted by Prof. J. L Lowes's admirable suggestion that the A. in

For in the floures of his youthe
In sondri wise, as he wel couthe,
Of Ditees and of Songes glade,
The whiche he for mi sake made,

Spanish (Castilian) proso by 'Juan de Cuenca, natural de Huete,' in 1400, whose
version is MS g ii 19, in the Library of the Escorial, Madrid. The Chaucer greeting
(Gower's Works, iii, 466 n, bk. viii, ll. 2941-56 ff.) runs thus: "Saluda de mi parte
a caucer, mi disciplo e mi poeta; quando con el topares, el qual por mi en la su
mancibia fiso toda su diligencia para componer y escreuir desyres e cantares de
diversas maneras de los quales toda la tierra es llena; por la qual cosa en especial le

[It is doubtful whether this allusion 'Turne hym to Troilus and talke þere
ynoghe' refers to Chaucer's Troilus, but there is a possibility that it may do so.
The whole Gest is an amplified englishing of Guido de Colonna’s Historia Trojana
(c. 1381-82), and the corresponding passage in Guido runs:—"Cedo, Troile, quæ te
tam juvenilis errare Coegit Credulitas, ut Briseidæ lacrimis crederes deceptivis et
ejus blanditiis"; and in what precedes and follows, the English book follows
Guido pretty closely; so that it seems likely that the passage is suggested by
him.]
