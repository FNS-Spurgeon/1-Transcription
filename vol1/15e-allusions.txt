[a. 1400.] Unknown. The Gest hystoriale of the destruction of Troy
Unique MS., Hunterian museum, Glasgow, bk. xix, fol 124 b,
ll. 8051-4 (ed. G. A. Panton and David Donaldson, E. E. T. soc.,
1869 and 1874, pp. 261-2).
The sorow of Troilus for Breisaid his loue.
. . . . . . . .
No lengur of thies louers list me to carpe,
Ne of the feynit fate of þat faire lady;
Who-so wilnes to wit of þaire wo fir,
Turne hym to Troilus, & talke þere ynoghe!
[It is doubtful whether this allusion 'Turne hym to Troilus and talke þere
ynoghe' refers to Chaucer's Troilus, but there is a possibility that it may do so.
The whole Gest is an amplified englishing of Guido de Colonna’s Historia Trojana
(c. 1381-82), and the corresponding passage in Guido runs:—"Cedo, Troile, quæ te
tam juvenilis errare Coegit Credulitas, ut Briseidæ lacrimis crederes deceptivis et
ejus blanditiis"; and in what precedes and follows, the English book follows
Guido pretty closely; so that it seems likely that the passage is suggested by
him.]
