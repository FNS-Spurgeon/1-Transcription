uncouth, strange and unpleasant to those that are affected
only with what is familiar and accustom'd to them, not
but there were even before those times some that had their
Poetical excellencies if well examin’d, and chiefly among the
rest CHAUCER, who through all the neglect of former ag’d
Poets still keeps a name, being by some few admir'd for his
real worth, to others not unpleasing for his facetious way,
which joyn'd with his old English intertains them with a kind

Esteem he was in the Age wherein he flourish’d, namely the
Reigns of Henry the 4th, Henry the 5th, and part of Henry

by the Honour he had to be allyed by marriage to the great
Earl of Lancaster, John of Gaunt: How great a part we have
lost of his Works above what Extant of him is manifest from

Poems, which are not in his publisht works; besides the

had a better Opinion of the state of a Sergeant, as he expresseth
in his Prologue of the Sergeant.
A Sergeant at Law wary and iise,

Discreet he wae, and of great Reverence.
