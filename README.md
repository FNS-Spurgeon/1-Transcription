 # 1-Transcription
This repository contains the transcription of the three volumes of *Five Hundred Years of Chaucer Criticism and Allusion* by Caroline Spurgeon (Cambridge, University Press, 1925), as well as the *Supplement* (Privatly printed, 1920).

## Data
For the three volumes, we used the digitisations made by Google for the University of Michigan ([Public Domain, Google-Digitized](https://www.hathitrust.org/the-collection/search-access/access-use-policy/#pd-us-google)). The facsimiles can be found on HathiTrust:

The *Supplement* has been digitised by the project's team. The images (CC-BY) are available in the folder (to come).
