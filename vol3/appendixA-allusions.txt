Chaucer's Monkes Tale in Trinity College, Cambridge MS., R. 3, 19.
[On folio 170 b a prohemium begins,
Worshipfull and dyscrete that here present be
I wyll yow tell a tale, two or thre,
which continues in the terms of the monk's opening speech,
Oxford Chaucer, B. 3158-3180. The first line as here given,
and the alteration in the second line are the work of the
person who made the extracts; the rest are all Chaucer's.
There follows the Monkes Tale, B. 3181-3196 (De Lucifero).
Then, because Chaucer has not done justice to Adam in his
one poor stanza, the scribe substitutes Lydgate’s long
account of Adam in the Fall of Princes, and certain envoys
from the same source, in Bk. I, chaps. 1, 3, 4, 8 (in part).
This takes up to folio 179a, where the scribe goes back
to Monkes Tale and completes it (with the exception of
Il. 3565-3588, and l. 364 which are omitted) from Sampson
to Cresus, B. 3205-3956.
Having completed the Monkes Tale, and added his Explicit,
the scribe goes on with the extracts and envoys from the
Fall of Princes, in the following order: Books I, chapters 6,
7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 18, 23; II, 2, 4, 6, 12, 13, 15, 21, 22, 25,
